# CS510-Midterm
## First Draft

Added the wrong file originally, but corrected this mistake.

The algorithmn might take a little longer to run because it is training on thousands of images. I had it as having 50 epochs at first, but each epoch was taking a minute, so I shortened it to 10. This should keep the idea of accuracy without losing too much of it.
